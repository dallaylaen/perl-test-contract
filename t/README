0xx - bootstrapping the core: is, contract_is, Test::Contract::Engine::TAP
    SHOULD bail_out on failure
1xx - the core functionality: basic conditions, contract getters.
2xx - Test::More compatibility: plan, extra TAP tests etc
3xx - API leftovers
4xx - optional/extra test conditions

Test::Contract::Basic::Is and Test::Contract::Engine::TAP
    SHOULD have 100% coverage.
